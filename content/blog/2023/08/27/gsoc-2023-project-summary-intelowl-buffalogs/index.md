Our [GSoC](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) student [Abheek](https://twitter.com/abheekblahblah) was working for three months for 2 different projects: [IntelOwl](https://intelowlproject.github.io/) and [Buffalogs](https://github.com/certego/BuffaLogs).

Considering that he created the new official site of IntelOwl during this period, we think that the better way to publish his results and work is there. :)

So this is the link to the official [blog post](https://intelowlproject.github.io/blogs/gsoc23_project_summary). Enjoy!
