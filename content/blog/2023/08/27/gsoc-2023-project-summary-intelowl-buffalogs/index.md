Our [Google Summer of Code (GSoC)](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) student [Abheek](https://twitter.com/abheekblahblah) was working for three months on 2 different projects: the open source threat intelligence platform [IntelOwl](https://intelowlproject.github.io/) and the log anomaly detection tool [Buffalogs](https://github.com/certego/BuffaLogs). He successfully redesigned IntelOwlProject's website, implemented JWT authentication for Buffalogs, added maps and graphs to the BuffaLogs dashboard, and created a frontend guide/tutorial for IntelOwl using react-joyride. Overall, it has been an extremely successful summer!

Considering that he created the new official site of IntelOwl, you can find a more in-depth report of his work on the new [blog](https://intelowlproject.github.io/blogs/gsoc23_project_summary). Enjoy!
